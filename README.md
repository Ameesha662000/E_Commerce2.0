# 🛒 E-Commerce Admin Dashboard

A full-stack E-Commerce Admin Dashboard built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. This dashboard is designed for administrators to manage the backend of an online store efficiently — including **user authentication**, **product management**, **order tracking**, and **search operations** — with the help of secure **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication.

- 📦 Perform CRUD operations on products (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- 🛒 Manage customer orders
- 🔍 Search/filter products quickly

This project helps developers understand how to build **RESTful APIs**, **connect a MongoDB database**, **use React for frontend admin interface**, and handle **authentication & authorization** using JWT.
